## Why?

The DOM-ORM project was created to provide a simple, easy-to-use, and lightweight way to store data objects without the need to setup and configure a database, users. That said, the project is not meant to replace databases, but rather to provide an alternative with a focus on tree structures like navigations, translations, etc.
